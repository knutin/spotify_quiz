SPOTIFY QUIZ
Author: Knut Nesheim <knutin@gmail.com>

Simple multiplayer game where the objective is to guess the track that is
playing faster than your opponents. The tracks are selected randomly from
the libraries of all players.

Dependencies:
 * Twisted (python-twisted in Ubuntu)
 * PyGame (python-pygame in Ubuntu)
 * pyspotify with alsahelper/osshelper (http://github.com/winjer/pyspotify)
 * spotify_appkey.key must be present in this directory

Due to the dependency on pyspotify and alsahelper/osshelper, the client will
only run on GNU/Linux. The server however, only relies on Twisted and can run
pretty much anywhere.
